## Usage

```sh
# Release build
# In folder llc
make all

# Running unit-tests
# In folder llc
make test


# Running a benchmark
cargo perf <benchmark> -- <args>
# For example print help for the `bench` benchmark
cargo perf bench -- -h

# Running LLFree tests with LLC
cargo test -- --test-threads 1
# only tests starting with "test::" are using the LLC allocator
# - different orders are ignored, because they are not implemented jet
# - test::parallel_malloc and test::parallel_mmap also dont use LLC, so they are ignored
```
